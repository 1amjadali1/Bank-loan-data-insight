**Advanced Bank Loan Data Analysis: Enhancing Decision-Making with Interactive Insights**
**Problem Statement:**
Current methods for loan data analysis lack depth and interactivity, limiting the ability to extract meaningful insights for informed decision-making. Traditional reporting techniques fail to provide a comprehensive view of lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance metrics. There is a critical need for advanced dashboard solutions to overcome these limitations and fully leverage our loan data.
**Objective:**
Our goal is to develop a suite of interconnected dashboards that offer dynamic and comprehensive insights into our loan data. These dashboards will equip decision-makers with actionable intelligence derived from thorough data analysis. Designed to provide a holistic view of lending operations, borrower demographics, loan performance, and financial metrics, the dashboards will support strategic decision-making through data-driven insights.
**Dashboard 1: Executive Summary**
**Purpose:**
This dashboard delivers an overview of essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) crucial for assessing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our lending activities.
**Key Features:**
- **Total Loan Applications:** Track the total number of loan applications as well as Month-to-Date (MTD) figures, and analyze Month-over-Month (MoM) trends for actionable insights.
- **Total Funded Amount:** Monitor the cumulative amount of funds disbursed and MTD disbursements, examining MoM variations to identify funding trends.
- **Total Amount Received:** Evaluate cash inflows by tracking the total and MTD amounts received from borrowers, and analyze MoM fluctuations to assess financial health.
- **Average Interest Rate:** Calculate and track the average interest rate across all loans, including MTD and MoM changes, to gauge the cost of lending.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Assess borrowers' financial resilience by calculating the average DTI for all loans and observing MTD and MoM changes.
